<p>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? 
    The benefits of IT tools is that its online which means youll always have access to to all the relevant information, you can easily share projects and project drafts within Trello which benefits team productivity and understanding. I do believe I could have been more efficient in terms of my own website by researching other helpful IT tools to boost the layout and functionality of my website.

    <p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    Ways to improve productivity would be to set out a clear well planned project structure at the beginning of the process, stop wasting time going off topic and adding in random code which has no relevance to your project, you should not stare at your screen for too long as this will affect your thought process if you take plenty of breaks you will increase efficiency and also minimise distractions if at all possible.

    <p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
    Solutions to improve my own productivity would be use some the points I have stated above in the previous paragraph, they say the best way to become a top developer is to become more productive by working less hours, I would incoperate small breaks even for one to two minutes get up and strech my legs whilst also giving my head that short break. If I was working within a team everyones workload would be set out at the start with brief catch ups throughout the day to improve efficiency, there would be no point someone going way ahead with one part of the project whilst someone else may be struggling, this is why slack, google hangouts and trello would be beneficial to the success of your project. Once I had this initial process done and with live documentation I would be able to undertake and note all the potential bugs or parts that need changing.

    <p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    I would go about testing by undertaking a number of steps. First of all I'd start off by planning the test process, this would be well planned and documented. I would then look at developing a test strategy which would incoperate my test objectives, my budget, industry standards,deadlines and risk identification with the end goal of that answering many questions.
