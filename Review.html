<p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
  <br>
I have found in making my own website that Trello and Visual Studio Code have really made the whole process a lot less complicated. I could map the whole process on Trello and approach each section piece by piece and click it as completed once I'd completed each stage. In the future I will look into researching other IT tools to help the process further such as Codepen and W3 schools to learn the different processes involved with creating different websites.
</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
  <br>
The IT tools in which were selected for this process were in my eyes appropriate for the creation of my website. In hindsight and with further investigation into other tools this may change but for now I believe them to be appropriate for the creation of my website.

<p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?
<br>  
If I was to assess my strengths in the completion of my project I would say my css and layout of my website to be visually engaging for all viewers, it is wasy read with a perfectly sized font. In saying this I do believe that my weakness comes in terms of advancements of my website, I have a funky background or a moving background, I created my website as a basic yet effective site. I didnt want to over complicate it and get trapped down a track I didnt know how to get out of. I do beleive that with time I can incoperate this into my future projects. I am very happy with my website for now, as a newbie to coding I've impressed myself and believe I can continue doing so with the help of further guidance from CodeNation.
</p> 
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
 Further improvements I could make to my project would be more information about myself and my background, I'd provide more information on past experiences and what I want to achieve. One of the main changes would be to try something different, weather that be a new layout, an interactive game or something to make the UX more enjoybable whilst navigating my website.</p>
 <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
 <p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
   I beleive after careful consideration the outcomes do match the requirements which were asked of me at the beginning. They were also fit for purpose but I also believe I have the oppurtunity to develop further and look to push myself further.
