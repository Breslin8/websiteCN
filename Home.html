        <p> A Little About Me: </p>
      <p>My name is Sion Breslin. I am 26 years old and come from a little place in Ireland called Donegal. I’ve recently relocated to Manchester to pursue any potential career opportunities. 
</p>

<b>


<p>Prior to relocating, I was a Trainee General Manager within a family hotel business, in this role I learnt many different skills such as team working and also the decision-making side of the business. I’ve always had a general interest in computers and how websites operate. My brother currently has his own booking software in which himself and two partners function all the code themselves. I have done some product developing for Uplisting which is my brother’s software and the ways in which it could be coded in and how it would look and operate. 
</p>

<p>I decided to join up with Code Nation as I believe the computer coding sector to be of great interest and with many opportunities for employment within the sector. I have undertaken FreeCodeCamp challenges but felt I also needed the classroom to fully learn the ins and outs of coding. 

    My experience so far of Code Nation has been a great one. Although it’s not based in a classroom I still find it incredibly easy to focus and understand what is being asked of me. I’ll definitely be recommending it to anyone that asks.
