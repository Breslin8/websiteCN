      <p> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    As a general rule with copyright you should always assume something is already copywrited,  work is not in the public domain simply because it has been posted on the Internet or because it lacks a copyright notice. Do not assume that materials labeled “royalty-free” or “copyright-free” can be distributed or copied without authorisation. Read the terms and conditions in any “Click to Accept” agreements (often called click-wrap agreements) or “Read Me” files ordinarily accompanying such materials to be certain that your intended use is permitted.</p>
