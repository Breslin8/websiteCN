<p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?
  <br>
  Answer....There are many different purposes for IT in modern business. Many businesses rely on communication methods online such as skype, slack and trello where employees can communicate with each other instantly. This, in turn, will improve work rate. IT also allows companies to keep up to date with the ever-changing trends of what’s in and what’s not. IT can also provide many opportunities for employees to learn new skills or upskill with these ever-changing trends and new jobs titles.

<p>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</p>
 <br>
 Answer.... Risks that might impact digital projects can be many different things such as, if the project isn't delieverd within the specified time, if the intial budget for the project has been exceeded, if the website doesnt actually operate as it was designed to be, the people that are going to be using the finished project don't have a general understanding of the project and how it works. This all links into the requiirments set out at the start of the project. If the time is taken to properly plan the project it will be more likely to succeed.

 <p>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
<br> 
The Need for Flexibility: Different technologies require different techniques. Object-oriented methods are best-suited for projects using object-oriented technologies whereas data-oriented methods are best-suited for data-oriented applications.
Every individual is unique. People are not replaceable parts. Each person has a different background, different preferences for the way in which they work, and different cognitive style (e.g. are they visual or textual thinkers?). An approach that works incredibly well for you might be impossible for me to grasp, and vice versa.
Every team is unique. Because teams are made up of individuals, and because individuals are unique, each team will require a unique way for them to work in order to maximize their potential.
Your external needs vary. Some projects must conform to government regulations. Other projects are highly-dependent on suppliers, such as technology vendors or software development outsourcers, and therefore must tune their process to reflect the ways that their suppliers need to work.
Project categories vary. Different types of projects, require different approaches because each category has different priorities and goals.
Method categories vary. Each category of method, for example agile and rigorous, has its strengths and weaknesses. You may need several different methods in order to make your project fully successfull.

<p>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes
<br>
Trello has been my best friend achieve my outcome. I have been able to organise each day with what I needed to do in order to move onto the next stage. This has greatly helped to keep everything on track and also not miss out on something which may have been missed if not using Trello. If this was a group project this would of been crucial to the work flow of all members along with slack. What I would next time would be allocate time slots for each task i.e Research(9:45-10:15) Code (10:20-12:30) whilst also keeping a section entirely open on different websites I liked and the reasons why. </p>

<p>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
  <br>
  Legal guidelines or GDPR as it is better known acts in many ways: Consumers have the right to opt out of consent of a website, They also have the right to be provided access to their presonal information stored, they also have the right to object to any information they wish to be witheld. If a business doesnt adhere to these guidelines it can prove be disasterous for them with fines issued if any data breachs have occured.
